This program logs into a user's spotify account and lets the user compare two playlists. Once logged in, the user will have a list of all of their playlists from Spotify. They can click a playlist to see the genre
breakdown of the playlist as well as the theme of the playlist. They can decide whether they want to add songs to or add songs from this current playlist. The user can select a second playlist for the opposite choice.
Once two playlists are selected the user can click compare playlists and they will see a side by side playlist comparison and a song-to-playlist fit score for the playlist they choice to add songs from. The user can
then select the songs that they want added to the "add songs to" playlist to add the selected songs directly into their spotify playlist.
